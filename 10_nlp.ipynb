    "In <<chapter_intro>> we saw that deep learning can be used to get great results with natural language datasets. Our example relied on using a pretrained language model and fine-tuning it to classify reviews. That example highlighted a difference between transfer learning in NLP and computer vision: in general in NLP the pretrained model is trained on a different task.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we call a language model is a model that has been trained to guess what the next word in a text is (having read the ones before). This kind of task is called *self-supervised learning*: we do not need to give labels to our model, just feed it lots and lots of texts. It has a process to automatically get labels from the data, and this task isn't trivial: to properly guess the next word in a sentence, the model will have to develop an understanding of the English (or other) language. Self-supervised learning can also be used in other domains; for instance, see [\"Self-Supervised Learning and Computer Vision\"](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/13/self_supervised/) for an introduction to vision applications. Self-supervised learning is not usually used for the model that is trained directly, but instead is used for pretraining a model used for transfer learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "我们所说的语言模型是一个经过训练的模型，它可以猜测文本中的下一个单词是什么（在阅读了前面的单词之后）。这种任务被称为 *自我监督学习* ：我们不需要给我们的模型贴标签，只需要给它提供大量的文本。它有一个从数据中自动获取标签的过程，而这项任务并不简单：要正确猜出句子中的下一个单词，模型必须对英语（或其他）语言有一定的理解。自监督学习也可用于其他领域，例如，请参阅[\"自监督学习与计算机视觉\"](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/13/self_supervised/)，了解有关视觉应用的介绍。自我监督学习通常不用于直接训练模型，而是用于预训练用于迁移学习的模型。"

    "The language model we used in <<chapter_intro>> to classify IMDb reviews was pretrained on Wikipedia. We got great results by directly fine-tuning this language model to a movie review classifier, but with one extra step, we can do even better. The Wikipedia English is slightly different from the IMDb English, so instead of jumping directly to the classifier, we could fine-tune our pretrained language model to the IMDb corpus and then use *that* as the base for our classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if our language model knows the basics of the language we are using in the task (e.g., our pretrained model is in English), it helps to get used to the style of the corpus we are targeting. It may be more informal language, or more technical, with new words to learn or different ways of composing sentences. In the case of the IMDb dataset, there will be lots of names of movie directors and actors, and often a less formal style of language than that seen in Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already saw that with fastai, we can download a pretrained English language model and use it to get state-of-the-art results for NLP classification. (We expect pretrained models in many more languages to be available soon—they might well be available by the time you are reading this book, in fact.) So, why are we learning how to train a language model in detail?\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason, of course, is that it is helpful to understand the foundations of the models that you are using. But there is another very practical reason, which is that you get even better results if you fine-tune the (sequence-based) language model prior to fine-tuning the classification model. For instance, for the IMDb sentiment analysis task, the dataset includes 50,000 additional movie reviews that do not have any positive or negative labels attached. Since there are 25,000 labeled reviews in the training set and 25,000 in the validation set, that makes 100,000 movie reviews altogether. We can use all of these reviews to fine-tune the pretrained language model, which was trained only on Wikipedia articles; this will result in a language model that is particularly good at predicting the next word of a movie review.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as the Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFit) approach. The [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) showed that this extra stage of fine-tuning of the language model, prior to transfer learning to a classification task, resulted in significantly better predictions. Using this approach, we have three stages for transfer learning in NLP, as summarized in <<ulmfit_process>>.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "我们在 <<chapter_intro>> 中用于对 IMDb 评论进行分类的语言模型是在维基百科上进行预训练的。我们将该语言模型直接微调为电影评论分类器，取得了很好的效果，但只要多做一步，我们就能做得更好。维基百科的英语与 IMDb 的英语略有不同，因此我们可以根据 IMDb 的语料库微调预训练的语言模型，然后将其作为分类器的基础，而不是直接跳转到分类器。\n",
    "\n",
    "即使我们的语言模型知道我们在任务中使用的语言的基础知识（例如，我们的预训练模型使用英语），习惯我们所针对的语料库的风格也是有帮助的。它可能是更非正式的语言，也可能是更专业的语言，需要学习新的单词或不同的造句方式。在 IMDb 数据集中，会有很多电影导演和演员的名字，语言风格通常没有维基百科中那么正式。\n",
    "\n",
    "我们已经看到，通过 fastai，我们可以下载一个经过预训练的英语语言模型，并利用它获得最先进的 NLP 分类结果。(我们期待更多语言的预训练模型很快就会问世--事实上，在你阅读本书的时候，它们可能已经问世了）。那么，我们为什么要详细学习如何训练语言模型呢？\n",
    "\n",
    "当然，其中一个原因是，了解所使用模型的基础很有帮助。但还有一个非常实用的原因，那就是如果在微调分类模型之前微调（基于序列的）语言模型，就能获得更好的结果。例如，在 IMDb 的情感分析任务中，数据集包括 50,000 篇没有附加任何正面或负面标签的额外电影评论。由于训练集中有 25,000 篇带标签的评论，验证集中有 25,000 篇带标签的评论，因此总共有 100,000 篇电影评论。我们可以使用所有这些影评来微调预训练语言模型，该模型只在维基百科文章中进行过训练；这将产生一个特别擅长预测影评下一个单词的语言模型。\n",
    "\n",
    "这就是所谓的通用语言模型微调（ULMFit）方法。论文](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146)表明，在将学习转移到分类任务之前，对语言模型进行额外的微调，能显著提高预测效果。使用这种方法，我们可以在 NLP 中进行三个阶段的迁移学习，如 <<ulmfit_process>> 所总结的那样。"

    "Notice that there are now some tokens that start with the characters \"xx\", which is not a common word prefix in English. These are *special tokens*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the first item in the list, `xxbos`, is a special token that indicates the start of a new text (\"BOS\" is a standard NLP acronym that means \"beginning of stream\"). By recognizing this start token, the model will be able to learn it needs to \"forget\" what was said previously and focus on upcoming words.\n",
    "\n",
    "These special tokens don't come from spaCy directly. They are there because fastai adds them by default, by applying a number of rules when processing text. These rules are designed to make it easier for a model to recognize the important parts of a sentence. In a sense, we are translating the original English language sequence into a simplified tokenized language—a language that is designed to be easy for a model to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the rules will replace a sequence of four exclamation points with a special *repeated character* token, followed by the number four, and then a single exclamation point. In this way, the model's embedding matrix can encode information about general concepts such as repeated punctuation rather than requiring a separate token for every number of repetitions of every punctuation mark. Similarly, a capitalized word will be replaced with a special capitalization token, followed by the lowercase version of the word. This way, the embedding matrix only needs the lowercase versions of the words, saving compute and memory resources, but can still learn the concept of capitalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the main special tokens you'll see:\n",

    "请注意，现在有一些标记以 \"xx\" 开头，而它在英语中并不是常见的单词前缀。这些是 *特殊标记* 。\n",

    "\n",
    "这些特殊标记并非直接来自 spaCy。它们之所以存在，是因为 fastai 在处理文本时应用了一系列规则，在默认情况下添加了它们。这些规则旨在让模型更容易识别句子的重要部分。从某种意义上说，我们是在将原始的英语语序翻译成一种简化的标记化语言--一种旨在让模型更容易学习的语言。\n",
    "\n",
    "例如，规则会用一个特殊的 *重复字符* 标记来替换一连串的四个感叹号，接着是数字四，然后是一个感叹号。这样，模型的嵌入矩阵就可以编码重复标点符号等一般概念的信息，而不需要为每一个标点符号的重复次数单独设置一个标记。同样，一个大写单词将被一个特殊的大写标记所替换，然后是该单词的小写版本。这样，嵌入矩阵只需要单词的小写版本，从而节省了计算和内存资源，但仍然可以学习大写的概念。\n",
    "\n",
    "下面是你会看到的一些主要的特殊标记：\n",

    "In addition to the *word tokenization* approach seen in the last section, another popular tokenization method is *subword tokenization*. Word tokenization relies on an assumption that spaces provide a useful separation of components of meaning in a sentence. However, this assumption is not always appropriate. For instance, consider this sentence: 我的名字是郝杰瑞 (\"My name is Jeremy Howard\" in Chinese). That's not going to work very well with a word tokenizer, because there are no spaces in it! Languages like Chinese and Japanese don't use spaces, and in fact they don't even have a well-defined concept of a \"word.\" There are also languages, like Turkish and Hungarian, that can add many subwords together without spaces, creating very long words that include a lot of separate pieces of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle these cases, it's generally best to use subword tokenization. This proceeds in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Analyze a corpus of documents to find the most commonly occurring groups of letters. These become the vocab.\n",
    "2. Tokenize the corpus using this vocab of *subword units*.\n",

    "除了上一节提到的 *词标记化* 方法外，另一种流行的标记化方法是 *子词标记化* 。单词标记化依赖于一种假设，即空格可以有效地分离句子中的意义成分。然而，这种假设并不总是合适的。例如，请看这个句子：我的名字是郝杰瑞。这在单词标记器中效果并不好，因为其中没有空格！汉语和日语等语言不使用空格，事实上，它们甚至没有定义明确的 \"词\" 的概念。还有一些语言，如土耳其语和匈牙利语，可以将许多子词加在一起而不留空格，从而创造出包含大量独立信息的超长单词。\n",

    "Going back to our movie reviews dataset, the first step is to transform the individual texts into a stream by concatenating them together. As with images, it's best to randomize the order of the inputs, so at the beginning of each epoch we will shuffle the entries to make a new stream (we shuffle the order of the documents, not the order of the words inside them, or the texts would not make sense anymore!).\n",
    "\n",
    "We then cut this stream into a certain number of batches (which is our *batch size*). For instance, if the stream has 50,000 tokens and we set a batch size of 10, this will give us 10 mini-streams of 5,000 tokens. What is important is that we preserve the order of the tokens (so from 1 to 5,000 for the first mini-stream, then from 5,001 to 10,000...), because we want the model to read continuous rows of text (as in the preceding example). An `xxbos` token is added at the start of each during preprocessing, so that the model knows when it reads the stream when a new entry is beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to recap, at every epoch we shuffle our collection of documents and concatenate them into a stream of tokens. We then cut that stream into a batch of fixed-size consecutive mini-streams. Our model will then read the mini-streams in order, and thanks to an inner state, it will produce the same activation whatever sequence length we picked.\n",

    "\n",
    "然后，我们将这个流切成一定数量的批次（这就是我们的 *批次大小* ）。例如，如果数据流中有 50,000 个词组，而我们设定的批量大小为 10，那么就会得到 10 个 5,000 个词组的迷你数据流。重要的是，我们要保持标记的顺序（第一个迷你流从 1 到 5000，然后从 5001 到 10000......），因为我们希望模型读取连续行的文本（如前面的例子）。在预处理过程中，我们会在每条数据流的开头添加一个 `xxbos` 标记，以便模型在读取数据流时知道新的条目正在开始。\n",

    "因此，概括地说，在每个时间点，我们都会对文档集合进行洗牌，并将它们串联成一个标记流。然后，我们将该流切割成一批固定大小的连续迷你流。然后，我们的模型会按顺序读取这些迷你流，由于有了内部状态，无论我们选择的序列长度是多少，它都会产生相同的激活。\n",

This should sound familiar: we had the same issue with images. In that case, we used cropping, padding, and/or squishing to make all the inputs the same size. Cropping might not be a good idea for documents, because it seems likely we'd remove some key information (having said that, the same issue is true for images, and we use cropping there; data augmentation hasn't been well explored for NLP yet, so perhaps there are actually opportunities to use cropping in NLP too!).

Additionally, to avoid memory issues and improve performance, we will batch together texts that are roughly the same lengths (with some shuffling for the training set). We do this by (approximately, for the training set) sorting the documents by length prior to each epoch. The result of this is that the documents collated into a single batch will tend to be of similar lengths. We won't pad every batch to the same size, but will instead use the size of the largest document in each batch as the target size. (It is possible to do something similar with images, which is especially useful for irregularly sized rectangular images, but at the time of writing no library provides good support for this yet, and there aren't any papers covering it.
